# Why have theory here ? 
The idea is not to re-invent the wheel but to have a categorized set of notes which contains my own questions and insights as I try to code certain things out.

I am thinking of first just using some lib to simulate the protocols and understand them and then maybe deep dive into the internals, may be implement some of the features of some protocols myself. May be create a two self-hosted containers locally talking with each other with these toy protocols and publish them and present them in a nice way, Maybe I can do live video explainers.

Its just my own playground to understand network stuff so that it can give me better insight on how I can pragmatically incorporate the mental models I gain from here in my real life system design. Because people on youtube drawing boxes doesn't give me enough confidence on whether their solution will help provide the best performance when actually coded.
